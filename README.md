# Khandha Rooms

This project has been designed for my friends studio outlining the services he can provide, along with key 
information on equipment and the studio itself. The **Khandha Rooms** project will showcase my ability to us HTML and CSS 
for my Milestrone Project 1.

## Project
The project will reflect what i have learnt so far from the Full Stack Developer course. After seeing my friends current webpage i felt it would be benefical to create
a page for his studio that had great UX, visually interesting and was concise enough to pass across the informatiom. 

The site will be made up of five indivudal pages with a consistant header and footer across all of them. The header will only change into a condensed version (burger) when scaled down for mobile use, 
along with header the footer will also simplify just to show social media links when scaled down. 
The five pages and thier purposes are as follows:

- **Home:** Simple design, eye catching image, slogan that pulls you into the site.
- **About:** Information on why the studio began/ owner / spotify link and previous clients.
- **Studio:** Key information on the studio itself e.g. size of each room, rack units and software used in the control room, live room equipment and mics.
- **Services:** Outline of services provided and three to four reviews of the studio.
- **Contact Us:** Contact form for direct inquiry, location image using google maps, address and email information.

## UX
This site calls attention to the services provided by Khandha Rooms. Exhibiting each indivudal service clearly and allowing users the ability to contact the studio directly
using a contact form. There is also an option to listen to previous works to check production quality via a spotify embedded button in the about page. 
The website fulfills the owners goals by guiding users to the service right for them, as well as offerinng an insight into previous clients whether it may be mixing, mastering or voiceover advertising.
