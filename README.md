# Khandha Rooms
[Live Site](https://adams-ears.github.io/Khandharooms/)

This project has been designed for my friend's studio outlining the services he can provide, along with key 
information on equipment and the studio itself. The **Khandha Rooms** project will showcase my ability to use HTML and CSS 
for my Milestrone Project 1.

## Project
The project will reflect what i have learnt so far from the Full Stack Developer course. After seeing my friends current web page I felt it would be beneficial to create
a page for his studio that had great UX, visually interesting and was concise enough to pass across the information. 

The site will be made up of five individual pages with a consistent header and footer across all of them. The header will only change into a condensed version (burger) when scaled down for mobile use, 
along with header the footer will also simplify just to show social media links when scaled down. 
The five pages and their purposes are as follows:

- **Home:** Simple design, eye catching image, slogan that pulls you into the site.
- **About:** Information on why the studio began/ owner / Spotify link and previous clients.
- **Studio:** Key information on the studio itself, e.g. size of each room, rack units and software used in the control room, live room equipment and microphones.
- **Services:** Outline of services provided and three to four reviews of the studio.
- **Contact Us:** Contact form for direct inquiry, location image using google maps, address and email information.

## UX
This site calls attention to the services provided by Khandha Rooms. Exhibiting each individual service clearly and allowing users the ability to contact the studio directly
using a contact form. There is also an option to listen to previous works to check the production quality via a Spotify embedded button in the about page. 
The website fulfills the owners' goals by guiding users to the service right for them, as well as offering an insight into previous clients whether it may be mixing, mastering or voiceover advertising.

### User Stories

- The user is able to contact the studio directly with clear information on their purpose.
- The user is able to browse services provided by the studio.
- The user is able to listen to examples of production quality from the studio.
- The user is able to see reviews from previous clients.

### Wireframes

### Design Progression

I ended up changing the original backgrounds I had chosen for the **Home**, **About**, **Studio** and **Contact** page. This is because as the website
progressed, I wanted the pages to flow and have a similar feel to ensure each page felt in keeping with the others. 
By changing the background on the mentioned pages, this led to making a change in the color scheme to more fitting and appealing colours. 

I decided to hide various images in the mobile view as it helped the website become less cluttered when scaled down, in turn it assisted the presentation
of the important information. I felt the decisions made to deviate from the wireframes were justified and were essential to 
provide an overall better user experience.

## Features

Here is a list of the features included on the site.

- Responsive navigations, navigation bar reduces into a burger drop down menu when the site is viewed on a smaller screen i.e mobile.
- Spotify embedded button allowing users to easily link to playlist from Khandha Rooms.
- Google maps embedded into contact page, allowing users to easily view the location of the studio.
- Contact form submisson, allowing user to inquire about services.
- Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter buttons integrated into footer to allow user to link to social networks.
- Mobile responsive design allowing webiste to be viewed clearly across various different devices including mobile and tablet.

## Technologies

Various different technologies have been used throughout my project, they are as follows:

- **Balsamiq** Rapid, effective and fun wireframing software.
- **Github** A cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
- **Git**  A Distributed Version Control tool that is used to store different versions of a file in a remote or local repository.
- **Gitpod** An online IDE, providing a full working development environment.
- **Github Pages** GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.
- **Bootstrap** A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Markdown** A lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.
- **HTML5** Another markup language, predominantly used to structure and present content to the world wide web.

### Browser Compatability
Browser compatability was tested across five different web browsers and these are:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Internet Explorer 11
- Safari
- Opera

The webpage was desinged using Google Chrome however functions on all browsers mentioned above. 

### Other testing

The webpage was submitted to the peer-code-review channel within the code institutes slack community.
This was extremely valuable for feedback from other mentors, module leads and students. It helped me to undersand what could be added or removed to make
the webpage more user friendly, as well as having access to feedback from a 'fresh set of eyes'.

## Deployment

**Github Pages** has been used to host my GitHub respository

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project after personally spending many hours in the studio itself and after seeing the current website,
I felt it would be a great service to Zachary Dorne to build him something new and fully responsive. 

I would like to thank Zachary for trusting me to build him a website for his business. I would also like to thank my mentor Jonathan Munz for being supportive 
of my ideas for the webpage and giving me the guidance needed to succeed in completing my project. Finally I would like to thank all of the slack 
community for the continued support throughout the course.
